# Jonas Artmeier - passionate about IT Strategy and Application Development


Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonas, an Austrian-German IT Consultant who developed a passion for coding.


## My Background:

In my 10+ years of professional experience in global IT companies, namely Oracle, IBM and Ingram Micro, I gained a broad knowledge of emerging technologies in areas like IoT or Cloud Computing. Since I worked for these multinational companies in Germany, Austria and Ireland, I bring broad insights into the global business partner landscape in the IT industry with me. I developed digital transformation strategies with global enterprises to become the industry leader.
To acquire a deeper technical understanding about IT infrastructure and code I successfully completed my training as Full Stack Web Developer. This enabled me to work independently on web projects in the front-, and backend.
